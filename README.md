Building reliable systems at the intersection of product and infrastructure. I've spent my career working on problems where "it works" isn't enough — it also needs to be auditable, tenant-isolated, and ready for the next order of magnitude.

**Recent highlight:** At **GoFundMe**, I designed and shipped an automated NPO claim flow that replaced a manual process — built under compliance, fraud-prevention, and scale constraints.

**What I reach for:**

**What I care about:** Good data models, clear service boundaries, systems that are correct before they're fast, and code that respects the next person who reads it.
